<string name="interpolation_help_linear">Linear interpolation draws a line directly between 
points.</string>
<string name="interpolation_help_cubic">Cubic interpolation draws an 'S' shaped curve between
two points.  This is cubic spine, with the controls points set such that the slope of the 
path entering and exiting a point will be as close to 0 as possible while being monotonically 
increasing on the X-axis. Note that this currently affects the display of the line only, 
it does not affect interpolation of points for the purposes of correlation.  Linear 
interpolation will be used.

<string name="interpolation_help_stepearly">StepEarly draws a continuous step function 
from one point to the next, where the interpolated data will rise or lower to the next 
datapoint immediately.  If a graph is descending, this will appear as a step in the form 
of the letter 'L').
</string>
<string name="interpolation_help_steplate">StepLate draws a continuous step function 
from one point to the next, where the interpolated data will retain the value of the 
previous datapoint until the next datapoint is encountered.

<string name="interpolation_help_stepmid">StepLate draws a continuous step function 
from one point to the next, where the interpolated data will rise or lower to the 
next point at the midpoint between data points.
