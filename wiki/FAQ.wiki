= You said this could be used with the Hacker's Diet.  How do I set up my categories? =

You'll need 1-3 categories, depending on if you want to track weight, body fat percentage, and/or rungs.  Since I do exercises separate from the "exercise rungs" used within the diet, I'll omit a configuration for that here.  Here's a sample configuration for weight and body fat percentage, where omitted fields should be filled in with value appropriate to your situation:
