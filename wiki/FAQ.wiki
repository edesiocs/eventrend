= You said this could be used with the Hacker's Diet.  How do I set up my categories? =

You'll need 1-3 categories, depending on if you want to track weight, body fat percentage, and/or rungs.  Since I do exercises separate from the "exercise rungs" used within the diet, I'll omit a configuration for that here.  Here's a sample configuration for weight and body fat percentage, where omitted fields should be filled in with value appropriate to your situation:

|| Group Name: || Hackers Diet ||
|| Category Name: || Weight ||
|| Aggregate By: || Day ||
|| Interpolation: || Cubic ||
|| Calculated: || (not selected) ||
|| Value Type: || Average ||
|| Zero Empty Period: || (not selected) ||

Feel free to set your goal, colors, as you prefer.  If you're weighing yourself in pounds or kilos, set "increment/decrement" to "1.0", or if you have a more accurate scale that measures 1/2 or 1/4 pounds (or kilos), you can set it to 0.5 or 0.25, respectively.  Any less than that probably wouldn't be accurate anyway, and will only make it so you have to press "+" or "-" more times to get to the value you want.

For a default value, I'd suggest entering something just a little below your current weight (if you're trying to gain weight, then something a little above your current weight.)  This will make it so there's a very small number of click required to enter a given weight, but gives you a little extra satisfaction when you lose enough that get to click the "-" button.

Now, whenever you add yourself, open the application, click the "+" or "-" button the get to the desired number (or use the keyboard), and click "Add."  With the categories configured as above, any weighings that occur on the same day will be averaged, and if you forget to weight yourself on a given day, the day will just be ignored.

Once you have some data entered, you can choose "Graph" or "Calendar View" from the menu on the main (category listing) screen, and see a graphical representation of your progress.
