<string name="interpolation_help_linear">Linear interpolation draws a line directly between 
points.  This, or Cubic, listed below, are good default choices.</string>
<string name="interpolation_help_cubic">In brief, this draws a curve between
points, like a letter "S".  In detail, this is cubic spline, with the controls points set such 
that the slope of the 
path entering and exiting a point will be as close to 0 as possible while being monotonically 
increasing on the X-axis. Note that this currently affects the display of the line only, 
it does not affect interpolation of points for the purposes of correlation.  Linear 
interpolation will be used.
</string>
<string name="interpolation_help_stepearly">In brief, this draws stair-steps between
points, moving up or down then across to the next point.  In detail, StepEarly draws 
a continuous step function 
from one point to the next, where the interpolated data will rise or lower to the next 
datapoint immediately.  If a graph is descending, this will appear as a step in the form 
of the letter "L").
</string>
<string name="interpolation_help_steplate">In brief, this draws stair-steps between
points, moving horizontal to the next point then up or down.  In deailt, StepLate draws
 a continuous step function 
from one point to the next, where the interpolated data will retain the value of the 
previous datapoint until the next datapoint is encountered.
</string>
<string name="interpolation_help_stepmid">In brief, this draws stair-steps between
points, with the vertical rise occuring halfway between points.  In detail,  StepLate 
draws a continuous step function 
from one point to the next, where the interpolated data will rise or lower to the 
next point at the midpoint between data points.
