Ok, if you're reading the source, it means you're either:
  - trying to see how I've done something to use in your own project (cool), or
  - you're interested in adding/subtracting/improving this codebase (yay!), or
  - you're just curious (?)
  
In any case, you should be aware that this started off as a basic 2-4K line
project to learn android basics, but due to feature requests, use over time, 
and other factors, it just kept growing into a reasonably good-sized hunk of
code.

As a result of the organic growth of this thing (and the fact that 
this is the first java I've coded in the last decade, much less UI code), it's
a bit messy.  It's also not very android-y in places -- there tickets in place 
to fix a lot of that up at the codesite 
(http://code.google.com/p/eventrend/issues/list), but we'll see what time 
I'll have available.

In terms of cleaning up the codebase, my primary concerns would definitely be
more tests, and it's apparent I need to factor some of the larger classes down 
into more manageable (and testable) pieces.  I need to use more intents and 
associated classes, like URIs, more extensively, as well as moving custom views
into the XML and creating stylable attributes.  Finally, I need to figure out if
positron (or something else) would be a good fit for functional tests.

So, if you want to jump on any of that -- or anything else -- feel free!
